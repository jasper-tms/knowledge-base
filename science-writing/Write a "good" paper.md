What makes a **good** scientific paper? If you're a scientist and you're either writing a paper yourself or providing feedback on someone else's paper, it's helpful to be able to concretely answer this question. If you're writing, this gives you something to aim at. If you're providing feedback, this gives you a rubric against which you can evaluate the draft you're reading. Experienced scientists will likely be able to point you to a few of their favorite papers, and they may even be able to explain some general principles of what makes a good paper in their mind as a way of explaining why they like those papers in particular. If you've read many scientific papers, you may be able to do the same. Being a 5th year PhD student at the time of writing this, I've read a lot of papers in the past few years and I've writing a few papers, and this is my attempt at putting into words some of my answers to the question "What makes a good scientific paper?" based on those experiences.

First of all, it's useful to draw a distinction between two somewhat (thought not entirely) separate aspects of a paper: what research and experiments were actually were done in the project, and how the results of that research are presented in the form of a paper. Scientists such as graduate students and postdocs usually go back and forth between a phase usually lasting multiple years of mainly doing experiments and collecting data, and then a phase often lasting 6-12 months (but this can vary widely) of creating figures and writing a manuscript about their work. For a given set of work that was performed in the first phase, there is a huge range of possible ways to shape it into a paper in the second phase. The content of this note has solely to do with that second phase; while it's pretty standard to have discussion with labmates about how to do well-motivated research and plan meaningful experiments, I feel like it's somewhat harder/rarer to get good concrete advice about principles to follow during the second phase. I've often heard advice like "writing a good paper is all about shaping your results into a good story" but that kind of statement is vague enough that it's not really helpful, and it just pushes the question back one step to "So how does one shape results into a good story?" which I haven't heard particularly many answers to. So here, the specific question I'm sharing my thoughts on is "assuming you (or your friend asking you to review their manuscript) have already done some set of research and experiments, what should you/your friend aim to do when writing a paper draft to have the best chance of producing what many people would consider a 'good' paper?" I'll share thoughts on three different factors I think are worth keeping in mind:

### 1. "Telling a story"
A good paper will usually follow a structure of "Here's where our research field was at previously (intro), here's how we moved the field forward (results), and here's what's interesting and important about the place we're at now (discussion)". You want readers to think about and comment on the ways in which the sections of your paper do or do not fit together in a way that clearly walks them through that process. 

### 2. The figures flow logically
Readers can easily understand how each section of the results builds on the previous section to move toward demonstrating a larger point. The logical flow from one figure panel or results section to the next is clear.

### 3. Every detail has clearly received attention
This includes things like pointing out errors or confusing things in the draft's text or figure panels.







When a scientist wants feedback on a draft of a paper, there are two common ways for that author to seek feedback:

1. They send the draft to their whole lab, and then a few days or a week later the lab has a 1-2 hour lab meeting to discuss the state of the paper and for lab members to make suggestions.
2. They send the draft to specific scientists outside their lab (collaborators, advisors/mentors, and/or friends) asking them to read it the draft and provide feedback.

In both of the situations above, the author will get more meaningful feedback if they are specific about what they want the readers to think about and provide feedback on. To do that, the author needs to provide some guidelines about "What makes a good paper?" that can serve as a rubric for readers to think about while evaluating the paper. Experienced scientists will have their own opinion on what makes a good paper, and that opinion will guide their process of evaluating your draft and providing feedback. When you and the reviewer have different ideas of what makes a good paper, their feedback might be confusing to you, and possibly won't be as useful. While there are many different ways to measure the quality of a paper, I'll highlight three that I think are important:

1. Big-picture: a good paper will clearly follow a structure of "Here's where our research field was at (intro), here's how we moved the field forward (results), and here's what's interesting and important about the place we're at now (discussion)". You want readers to think about and comment on the ways in which the sections of your paper do or do not fit together in a way that clearly walks them through that process. 

2. Readers can easily understand how each section of the results builds on the previous section to move toward demonstrating a larger point. The logical flow from one figure panel or results section to the next is clear.

3. The details are precise and well thought out. This includes things like pointing out errors or confusing things in the draft's text or figure panels.

If all the author asks is "Could you please read my manuscript and give me your feedback?", readers often give a lot more small-scale feedback than bigger-picture feedback on whether the contents of the paper fit together in a way that feels clear and logical.
 One effective way to do this is for the author to provide a bulleted list (3-4 items) of what they themselves view as the main contributions of the paper, and then ask for feedback about whether or not the paper effectively conveys those contributions. For the author to create a good list of main contributions, they should ask themselves questions like "What do I imagine my paper would get cited for?". After making this list, the author can send out the paper along with this list of 3-4 main contributions bullet points and a list of specific questions for readers to think about like the following:

1. Does the introduction section do a good job explaining what gaps in technology and/or gaps in understanding this paper is trying to address, and why filling in those gaps would matter?
2. Is it clear how each figure and each section of the results relates to and supports the paper's goals?
3. Is sufficient evidence presented for each of the main contributions I listed above that you believe they're all true and/or useful?
4. Does the discussion section put this paper's technological and conceptual advances in the context of other work in the field in a way that's interesting and memorable?
